# Zoom-Duration-Calculator
It is used for CivilCon'21 to calculate the attendees' attendence mins.

There are more than 1 scripts to merge more. I could use a Class, but I had short period of time and I just created several scripts. That's why it is a bit manual, but with quick update, scripts can be merged. (no need for now, hence I won't :))
